Various workflows for processing remotely sensed data
=====================================================

Contents
--------

**L1_LIDAR**

Processing L1 LiDAR from the m-300 drone. Prerequisites are python, pointutils and cloud compare.
Includes preproc, classification and extracting info from the resulting maps. 

For the point cloud work you will need Pointutils for this which is found `here <https://github.com/Ciaran1981/pointutils>`_.

For the canopy cover prediction you will need geospatial_learn which is found `here <https://github.com/Ciaran1981/geospatial-learn>`_. 

**TS**

Some time series work, e.g. downloading bare soil maps, veg indices, classifying crops.

You will need eot for this which is found `here <https://github.com/Ciaran1981/eot>`_.
